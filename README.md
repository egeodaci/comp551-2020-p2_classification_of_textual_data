# comp551-2020-p2_kaggle_reddit_classification
In this project we will develop models to analyze text from the website Reddit (https://www.reddit.com/), a popular social media forum where users post and comment on content in different themed communities, or subreddits. The goal of this project is to develop a supervised classification model that can predict what community a comment came from. You will be competing with other groups to achieve the best accuracy in a competition for this prediction task.
